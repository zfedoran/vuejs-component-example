# Description
Simple component example without the use of fancy WebPack plugins. This is perfect for CMS projects where the build system cannot be controlled due to business rules or tech requirements. For certain projects, this can be a very attractive solution. Not recommended when you have full control over your server environment.

The components make use of a clever JavaScript trick in order to find its own HTML.
